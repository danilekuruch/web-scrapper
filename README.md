This is the *Text-Based Browser* project I made myself.


<p>Having the option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal can really come in handy. Let's use Python to create a text-based browser. In this project, you will create a simplified browser that will ignore JS and CSS, won't have cookies, and only will show a limited set of tags. But it will still be good enough for some situations, and building it will be fun!<strong> </strong>You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</p>
